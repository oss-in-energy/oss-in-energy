The following is a collection of tools and software for the energy sector.

- You feel like something is missing here? Please help improving this list by PR on github!
- You can download a csv version of the table [here {{< fontawesome file-csv >}}](table.csv)

{{< license-cc >}}

### Explanation of the columns:

- The columns _Project_, _Repository URL_, _Description_ and _Homepage_ are taken directly from the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/oss-in-energy/oss-in-energy/blob/master/projects.yaml)
- _License_, _Languages_, _Tags/Topics_ and _First Release_ are usually automatically fetched, but might be overriden in the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/oss-in-energy/oss-in-energy/blob/master/projects.yaml)
- _Last Update_ and _Latest Release_ can only be set automatically. If these are empty, that's because we can only query Github and Gitlab repositories at the moment.
